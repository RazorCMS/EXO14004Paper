\date{\today}

\abstract{A search for dark matter particles directly produced in proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC is

\section{Introduction}

The existence of dark matter (DM) in the universe, originally proposed~\cite{Zwicky:1937zza} to
reconcile observations of the Coma galaxy cluster with
the prediction from the virial theorem, is
commonly accepted as the explanation of many experimental
phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology, such as galaxy rotation
curves~\cite{vandeHulst,Rubin:1980zd}, large structure
formation~\cite{White:1987yr,Carlberg:1989yr,Springel:2005nw}, and the
observed
spectrum~\cite{Smoot:1992td,deBernardis:2000gy,Spergel:2006hy,Ade:2013zuv}
of the cosmic microwave background~\cite{Bardeen:1985tr}. A global fit to
cosmological data in the $\Lambda$CDM model (also known as
the standard model of cosmology)~\cite{Cen:2000xv} suggests that
approximately 85\% of the mass of the universe is attributable to
DM~\cite{Ade:2013zuv}. To accommodate these observations and the
dynamics of colliding galaxy clusters~\cite{Clowe:2006eq}, it has been
hypothesized that DM is made mostly of weakly
interacting massive particles
(WIMPs), sufficiently massive to be in nonrelativistic motion
following their decoupling from the hot particle plasma in the early
stages of the expansion of the universe.

While the standard model (SM) of particle physics does not include a
viable DM candidate, several models of physics beyond the SM, e.g.,
supersymmetry (SUSY)~\cite{Ramond,Golfand,Volkov,Wess,Fayet} with $R$-parity
conservation, can accommodate the existence of WIMPs. In these models,
pairs of DM particles can be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at
the CERN LHC. Dark matter particles would not leave a detectable signal in
a particle detector. When produced in association with high-energy
quarks or gluons, they could provide event topologies with
jets and a transverse momentum (\pt) imbalance ($\ptvecmiss$). The magnitude of $\ptvecmiss$ is referred to as missing transverse energy ($\ETm$).
The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported searches for events with one
high-\pt jet and large $\ETm$~\cite{Aad:2011xw,Chatrchyan:2012me}, which are sensitive to such topologies.
In this paper, we refer to these studies as monojet searches. Complementary studies of events with
high-\pt photons~\cite{Khachatryan:2014rwa,Aad:2014tda}; \PW,
\cPZ,~or
Higgs~bosons~\cite{Aad:2013oja,Aad:2014vka,Aad:2015dva,Aad:2015yga};
b jets~\cite{Aad:2014vea} and top quarks~\cite{Aad:2014vea,CMS:b2g12-022,CMS:semilepTop}; and leptons~\cite{ATLAS:2014wra,Khachatryan:2014tva}
have also been performed.

This paper describes a search for dark matter particles $\chi$ in events with at least two jets of comparable transverse momenta
and sizable $\ETm$. The search is based
on the razor variables $\MR$ and $\RR^2$~\cite{rogan,razor2010}.  Given a
dijet event, these variables are computed from the two jet momenta $\vv{p}^{j_1}$ and
$\vv{p}^{j_2}$, according to the following
definition:
 \begin{align}
 \begin{split}
 \MR  & =
 \sqrt{
  (\abs{\vv{p}^{j_1}}+\abs{\vv{p}^{j_{2}})^2 -
  (p^{j_1}_{z}+p^{j_2}_{z})^2}},
\\
 \mathrm{R}  & =   \frac{M^{\RR}_\mathrm{T}}{\MR},
\label{eq:razor}
\end{split}\\
\intertext{with}
 \label{eq:MTR}
 M^{\RR}_\mathrm{T}  &=   \sqrt{ \frac{\ETm(\pt^{j_1}+\pt^{j_2}) -
   \ptvecmiss {\cdot}
   (\vv{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\,j_1}+\vv{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{j_2})}{2}}.
\end{align}

In the context of SUSY, $\MR$ provides an estimate of the
underlying mass scale of the event, and quantity $M^{\RR}_\mathrm{T}$ is a transverse
observable that includes information about the
topology of the event. The variable $\RR^2$ is designed to reduce QCD
multijet background; it is correlated with the angle
between the two jets, where co-linear jets have large $\RR^2$ while back-to-back jets have small $\RR^2$.
These variables have been used to study the production of non-interacting
particles in cascade decays of heavier partners, such as squarks and
gluinos in SUSY models with $R$-parity
conservation~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014goa,Razor8TeV}. The sensitivity of
these variables to direct DM production was suggested in
Ref.~\cite{Fox:2012ee}, where it was pointed out that the dijet event
topology provides good discrimination against background processes,
with a looser event selection than that applied in the monojet searches.
Sensitivity to DM production is most enhanced for large values of $\RR^2$, while
categorizing events based on the value of $\MR$ yields search sensitivity to
a broader and more inclusive class of DM models. The resulting sensitivity is comparable to that of monojet 
searches~\cite{Fox:2012ee,Papucci:2014iwa}. This
strategy also offers the possibility to search for DM particles that
couple preferentially to b quarks~\cite{Agrawal:2014una}, as proposed
to accommodate the observed excess of photons with energies between
1 and 4\GeV in the gamma ray spectrum of the galactic center data collected by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray space
telescope~\cite{Hooper:2010mq}. The results are interpreted using an
effective field theory approach and the Feynman diagrams for DM pair production are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DMdiamgrams}.

   axial-vector operator (left), and a scalar operator (right).\label{fig:DMdiamgrams}}
\end{figure}


Unlike the SUSY razor searches~\cite{Razor8TeV,razor2010}, which focus on events with large
values of $\MR$, this study also considers events with small values
of $\MR$, using $\RR^2$ to discriminate
between signal and background, in a kinematic region ($\RR^2 >
0.5$) excluded by the baseline selection of Refs.~\cite{Razor8TeV,razor2010}.

A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
18.8\fbinv of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8\TeV  was collected by the CMS experiment
 with a trigger based on a
loose selection on $\MR$ and $\RR^2$. This and other
special triggers were operated in 2012 to record events at a rate
higher than the CMS computing system could process during data
taking. The events from these triggers were stored on tape and their
reconstruction was delayed until 2013, to profit from the larger availability of processing resources during the LHC shutdown.
These data, referred to as ``parked data''~\cite{CMS-DP-2012-022},
enabled the exploration of events with small $\MR$
values, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to direct DM production.

This paper is organized as follows: the CMS detector is briefly described
in Section~\ref{cmsdetector}.  Section~\ref{sec:sample}
describes the data and simulated samples of events used in the
analysis. Sections~\ref{sec:selection} and~\ref{sec:sampleDef} discuss
the event selections and categorization, respectively. The
estimation of the background is described in Section~\ref{sec:bkg}.
The systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:sys},
while Section~\ref{sec:interpretation} presents the results and the
implications for several models of DM production. A summary is given in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{The CMS detector}\label{cmsdetector}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid
of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon
pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter
(HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections.
When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15\% at 10\GeV, 8\% at 100\GeV, and 4\% at 1\TeV~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013dga}. Muons are
measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return
yoke outside the solenoid. Forward calorimeters extend the
pseudorapidity ($\eta$)~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk} coverage provided by the
barrel and endcap detectors. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom
hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon
detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time
interval of less than 4\mus. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor
farm further decreases the event rate from around 100\unit{kHz} to
around 400\unit{Hz}, before data storage. A more
detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition
of the coordinate system used and the basic kinematic variables, can
be found in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.

\section{Data set and simulated samples}
\label{sec:sample}
The analysis is performed on events with two jets reconstructed at L1
in the central part of the detector ($\abs{\eta}< 3.0$). The L1 jet
triggers are based on the sums of
transverse energy in regions $\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi$
approximately 1.05$\times$1.05 in
size~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk} (where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the plane transverse to the LHC beams.).
At the HLT, energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL are clustered into jets and the
razor variables $\RR^2$ and $\MR$ are computed. In the
HLT, jets are defined using the {\FASTJET}~\cite{fastjet}
implementation of the anti-\kt~\cite{antikt} algorithm, with
a distance parameter equal to 0.5. Events with at least two jets
with $\pt>64$\GeV are
considered. Events are selected with $\RR^2> 0.09$ and
$\RR^2 \times \MR > 45$\GeV. This selection
rejects the majority of the background, which tends to have low $\RR^2$ and low
$\MR$ values, while keeping the events in the signal-sensitive
regions of the ($\MR$, $\RR^2$) plane.
The trigger efficiency, measured using a pre-scaled trigger with very loose thresholds, is
shown in Table~\ref{tab:Trigger}.  The requirements described above correspond to the least stringent event selection, given the constraints on the maximum acceptable rate.

    $\MR$ regions. The selection $\RR^2 > 0.35$ is applied.}

\end{table}

Monte Carlo (MC) simulated signal and background samples are generated with the
leading order matrix element generator {\MADGRAPH
  v5.1.3}~\cite{Alwall:2011uj,Alwall:2014hca} and the CTEQ6L parton
distribution function set~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw}. The generation
includes the \PYTHIA 6.4.26~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} Z2* tune, which is
derived from Z1 tune~\cite{Field:2010bc} based on the CTEQ5L set.
Parton shower and hadronization effects are included by matching the generated events to \PYTHIA, using the MLM matching algorithm~\cite{Hoche:2006ph}.
The events are processed with a \GEANTfour~\cite{G4} description of the CMS apparatus to include
detector effects. The simulation samples for SM
background processes are scaled to the
integrated luminosity of the data sample (18.8\fbinv), using
calculations of the inclusive production cross sections at the next-to-next-to-leading
order (NNLO) in the perturbative QCD
expansion~\cite{WatNNLO,ZatNNLO,TTbaratNNLO}.
 The signal processes corresponding to pair production of DM particles
 are simulated with up to two additional partons with $\pt>80$\GeV.



\section{Event selection}\label{sec:selection}

Events are selected with at least one reconstructed
interaction vertex within $\abs{z}<24$\cm. If more than one vertex is
found, the one with the highest sum of the associated track momenta squared is used as the
interaction point for event reconstruction. Events containing
calorimeter noise, or large missing transverse momentum
due to beam halo and instrumental effects (such as jets near
non-functioning channels in the ECAL) are removed from the analysis~\cite{MET_8TeV}.

A particle-flow (PF) algorithm~\cite{PF1,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001} is used to reconstruct
and identify individual particles with an optimized combination of
information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy
of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected
for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined
from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction
vertex as measured by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding
ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons (or emissions)
spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The
energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the associated
track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination
of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and
HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for
the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic
showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the
corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. Contamination of the
energy determinations from other pp collisions is mitigated by
discarding the charged PF candidates incompatible with originating from the interaction point.  Additional
energy from neutral particles is subtracted on average when computing
lepton (electron or muon) isolation and jet energy. This contribution is estimated as the
per-event energy deposit per unit area, in the cone $\Delta R = \sqrt{\smash[b]{(\Delta
  \eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}}=0.3$, times the considered jet size or
isolation cone area.

Electrons (muons) are required to have $\pt>15$\GeV and  $\abs{\eta}<2.5$
(2.4). In order to reduce the
background from hadrons misidentified as leptons, additional
requirements based on the
quality of track reconstruction and isolation are applied. Lepton isolation is
defined as the scalar \pt sum of all PF candidates other than the
lepton itself, within a cone of size $\Delta R = 0.3$, and normalized to the lepton \pt. A
candidate is identified as a lepton if the isolation variable is found to be smaller than 15\%.
For electrons~\cite{ElectronsCMS}, a characteristic of the shower
shape of the energy deposit in the ECAL (the shower width in the
$\eta$ direction) is used to further reduce the contamination from hadrons.


Jets are formed by clustering the PF candidates, using the anti-\kt algorithm with distance
parameter 0.5. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all
particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within
5\% to 10\% of the generated hadron level jet momentum over the whole \pt spectrum and
detector acceptance.
 Jet energy corrections
are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ
measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events.
Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove
spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions.
We select events containing at least two jets with $\pt>80$\GeV and $\abs{\eta}<2.4$, for
which the corresponding L1 and HLT requirements are maximally
efficient. The combined secondary vertex (CSV) b-tagging
algorithm~\cite{btag8TeV,btag7TeV} is used to identify jets originating from b
quarks. The loose and tight working points of the CSV algorithm, with
85\% (10\%) and 50\% (0.1\%) identification efficiency (misidentification probability) respectively, are
used to assign the selected events to categories based on the number
of b-tagged jets, as described below.

In order to compute the razor variables inclusively, the event is forced into a two-jet topology, by forming two \textit{megajets}~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014goa} out of all the reconstructed
jets with $\pt>40$\GeV and $\abs{\eta}<2.4$. All possible assignments of
jets to the megajets are considered, with the requirement that a
megajet consist of at least one jet. The sum of the four-momenta of
the jets assigned to a megajet defines the megajet
four-momentum. When more than two jets are reconstructed, more than
one megajet assignment is possible. We select the assignment that
minimizes the sum of the invariant masses of the two megajets.
In order to reduce the contamination from multijet production, events are
rejected if the angle between the two selected megajets in the
transverse plane $\abs{ \Delta\phi (j_{1}, j_{2})}$ is larger
than 2.5 radians. The momenta of the two megajets are used to compute
the razor variables, according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:razor},~\ref{eq:MTR}).  Events are
required to have $\MR>200$\GeV and $\RR^2>0.5$.

\section{Event categories}\label{sec:sampleDef}

Events are classified according to the muon and
b-tagged jet multiplicities.  Eight regions are defined, as summarized
in Tables~\ref{tab:boxes} and~\ref{tab:boxes1}.

The events with no b-tagged jets are divided into three samples: 0$\mu$,
1$\mu$, and 2$\mu$. The 2$\mu$ sample includes events with two or more
muons with at least one muon pair that has an invariant
mass $80 < M_{\mu\mu} \le 100\GeV$. The $1\mu$ sample is
composed of the events with exactly one muon. The $0\mu$ sample
(events with no muons) is used
to search for candidate signal events; the 1$\mu$, 2$\mu$ samples are used to predict
the background in the 0$\mu$ sample.

Similarly, five samples of selected events with b-tagged jets are
defined: 0$\mu$bb, 0$\mu$b, 1$\mu$b, 2$\mu$b, and
$\cPZ(\mu\mu)$b. The 2$\mu$b sample contains events with $10<
M_{\mu\mu} <75$\GeV or $105< M_{\mu\mu} <200\GeV$,
while the $\cPZ(\mu\mu)$b sample includes events with $80<
M_{\mu\mu} \leq 100$\GeV. The signal is searched for in the
0$\mu$bb and 0$\mu$b samples.

Events in the 0$\mu$, 1$\mu$, and 2$\mu$ samples are further
classified according to their $\MR$ value: (i) \textit{very low} $\MR$ (VL), defined by $200<\MR
\leq 300$\GeV; (ii) \textit{low} $\MR$ (L), with $300
<\MR \leq 400$\GeV; (iii) \textit{high} $\MR$ (H),
with $400 <\MR\leq 600$\GeV; and (iv) \textit{very high}
$\MR$ (VH), including events with $\MR>600$\GeV. Owing to the smaller sample size, no
$\MR$ classification is performed for the events with b-tagged
jets.
In the H and VH categories, 3\% and 35\% respectively of the selected
events were also selected in the monojet search~\cite{monojet8TeV}, which used data from the same running period.
The overlap
in the L and VL categories is negligible, while the overlapping events in the H and VH categories were shown not to have an impact on the final sensitivity. Consequently, the results
from this analysis and from the monojet analysis are largely statistically independent.

\section{Background estimation}\label{sec:bkg}

Multijet production is the most abundant source of events with jets
and unbalanced \pt. Because of measurement uncertainties and the loss
of jets falling outside the $\eta$ acceptance, the reconstruction
of multijet events may result in large \MET without the presence of
non-interacting particles in the final state. Based on simulated
events, this background should be reduced to a negligible level
by the event requirements based on the razor variables and $\abs{ \Delta\phi (j_{1}, j_{2})}$ (see
Section~\ref{sec:selection}). This anticipated background reduction
is confirmed in data control regions with looser cuts on the razor variables.

The largest background contribution to the 0$\mu$ sample comes from events in which a W or Z boson is
produced, in association with jets, and decays to a final state with one or more neutrinos. These
background processes are referred to as $\PW(\ell\nu)$+jets
and $\cPZ(\PGn\PAGn)$+jets events. Additional backgrounds arise from events involving the production of top quark pairs, and from
events in which a $\cPZ$ boson decays to a pair of charged
leptons. These processes are referred to as $\ttbar$ and
$\cPZ(\ell \ell)$+jets, respectively. Using
simulated samples, the contribution from other SM processes, such as
diboson production, is found to be negligible.

The main background in the 0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb samples comes from
$\ttbar$ events. The use of the tight working point of the CSV
algorithm reduces the presence of $\cPZ(\PGn\PAGn)$+jets
and $\PW(\ell\nu)$+jets events to 22\% and 10\%, respectively.

The rest of this section describes the estimation of background in the signal samples using control samples in data and the comparison to the
observed yields.

\subsection{Background estimation for the \texorpdfstring{0$\mu$}{0 mu} sample\label{sec:bkgzmu}}


For events without b-tagged jets, the data yields observed in the
1$\mu$ sample are used to predict the background from $\PW(\ell\nu)$+jets and
$\cPZ(\PGn\PAGn)$+jets in the 0$\mu$ sample.  Similarly, the
observed yield in the 2$\mu$ samples allows the estimation of
the contamination from $\cPZ(\ell \ell)$+jets in the 0$\mu$ sample. Each
$\MR$ category is binned in $\RR^2$. Using the simulated background samples, scaled to the
integrated luminosity of the data, the binning in each category is
chosen so that there are no bins with zero entries.

The background expected from $\PW$ and $\cPZ$ boson production, in
each $\RR^2$ bin and in each $\MR$ category of the 0$\mu$
sample, is computed as
\begin{equation}
  n_{i}^{0\mu} =  \Bigl(n_{i}^{1\mu} - N_{i}^{\ttbar,1\mu} - N_{i}^{\cPZ(\ell
    \ell)+\text{jets},1\mu}\Bigr) \frac{N_{i}^{\PW(\ell\nu)+\text{jets},0\mu}+N_{i}^{\cPZ(\PGn\PAGn)+\text{jets},0\mu}}{N_{i}^{\PW(\ell\nu)+\text{jets},1\mu}} +
\Bigl(n_{i}^{2\mu} - N_{i}^{\ttbar,2\mu}\Bigr) \frac{N_{i}^{\cPZ(\ell \ell)+\text{jets},0\mu}}{N_{i}^{\cPZ(\ell \ell)+\text{jets},2\mu}},
\end{equation}
where $n_{i}^{k\mu}$ labels the data yield in bin $i$ for the sample
with $k$ muons, and $N_{i}^{X,k\mu}$ indicates the corresponding yield
for process $X$, derived from simulations.

This background estimation method relies on the assumption that
the kinematic properties of events in which $\PW$ and $\cPZ$ bosons are
produced are similar.

As a cross-check of the method, the observed yield in the 2$\mu$ sample is used to
predict the 1$\mu$ yield. Simulated event samples are used to estimate
the ratio of 1$\mu$ to 2$\mu$ events in each bin, and the small
contribution from $\ttbar$ events.
In Table~\ref{tab:bkg1mu}, the observed yields in the 1$\mu$ sample
are compared to the estimate derived from data. The contribution of each process is also given,
as predicted directly by simulated samples and therefore not used in
the final result. For completeness, the corresponding
information for the 2$\mu$ sample is given in Table~\ref{tab:bkg2mu}.

\subsection{Background estimation for the \texorpdfstring{0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb}{0 mu b and 0 mu bb} samples}
A technique similar to that described in Section~\ref{sec:bkgzmu} is used to determine the
expected background for the 0$\mu$b and the 0$\mu$bb samples.

The background from $\ttbar$ events for each $\RR^2$ bin in the
0$\mu$b sample, $n(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\PQb}$, is computed as:
\begin{equation}
  n(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\PQb} =  \bigl(n(\ttbar)_{i}^{2\mu\PQb} - N_{i}^{\cPZ(\ell
    \ell)+\text{jets},2\mu\PQb} - N_{i}^{\PW(\ell\nu)+\text{jets},2\mu\PQb}\bigr)
\frac{N(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\PQb}}{N(\ttbar)_{i}^{2\mu\PQb}}\label{eq:bBkgPred}
\end{equation}
where $n(\ttbar)_{i}^{2\mu\PQb}$ is the observed yield in the $i$th $\RR^2$
bin for the 2$\mu$b sample, while $N(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\PQb}$ and
$N(\ttbar)_{i}^{2\mu\PQb}$ are, respectively, the corresponding $\ttbar$ yields in the $i$th $\RR^2$
bin for the 0$\mu$b and 2$\mu$b samples derived from
the simulated \ttbar sample. Similarly, the \ttbar background in the
0$\mu$bb sample is derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:bBkgPred}), replacing
$N(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\PQb}$ with $N(\ttbar)_{i}^{0\mu\mathrm{bb}}$, the \ttbar
background yield in the $i$th bin of the 0$\mu$bb sample, predicted
from the simulated \ttbar events. The data yield in the 2$\mu$b sample is
corrected to account for the small contamination from $\cPZ$+jets and
 $\PW$+jets, predicted with the simulated yields $N_{i}^{\cPZ(\ell\ell)+\text{jets},2\mu\PQb}$ and
    $N_{i}^{\PW(\ell\nu)+\text{jets},2\mu\PQb}$, respectively.


The background contribution from $\PW(\ell \nu)$+jets and $\cPZ(\PGn\PAGn)$+jets events is predicted using the $\cPZ(\mu\mu)$b sample,
having a $\cPZ$+jets purity ${\approx}$89\% (see
Table~\ref{tab:WITHB}). The observed yield in the $\cPZ(\mu\mu)$b
sample is shown in the left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Zmumub}, as a
function of $\RR^2$. This contribution, scaled by the ratio of the predicted V+jets background in the signal region to that in the control sample, obtained from simulation, provides an
estimate for each $\RR^2$ bin. In Table~\ref{tab:WITHB}  and
in the left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Zmumub}, discrepancies between the observation and the prediction could be
larger than the quoted uncertainty, since the latter accounts only for the
statistical uncertainty of the simulated sample.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}\label{sec:sys}

For each $\RR^2$ bin in each $\MR$ category, the
difference between the observed and estimated yields in the
crosscheck analysis (see Section~\ref{sec:bkg}) is taken as the estimate of the uncertainty associated with the
method. The uncertainty is found to
be ${\approx}$20--40\%, depending on the considered bin in the
($\MR$, $\RR^2$) plane.

For the 0$\mu$ analysis, differences between the kinematic properties of $\PW$+jets and
$\cPZ$+jets events are additional sources of systematic uncertainty. These
differences arise from the choice of the PDF set, jet energy scale
corrections, b tagging efficiency
corrections, and trigger efficiency. These effects largely cancel when taking the ratio of the two processes, and the resulting
uncertainty is found to be smaller than one fifth
of the total uncertainty.  The quoted uncertainty is an upper
estimate of the total systematic uncertainty.

For the 0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb samples, both the signal and control samples are dominated by \ttbar events. The cancellation of the
systematic uncertainties is even stronger in
this case, since it does not involve different processes, and different
PDFs. The remaining uncertainty is
dominated by the contribution arising from the small size of the control
sample.

Systematic uncertainties in the signal simulation
originate from the choice of the PDF set,
the jet energy scale correction, the modeling of the initial-state radiation in the event
generator, and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity. The
luminosity uncertainty changes the signal normalization while the other
uncertainties also modify the signal shape.
These effects are taken into account by propagating these
uncertainties into the $\MR$ category and the $\RR^2$ bin. These uncertainties are
considered to be fully correlated across $\MR$ categories and
$\RR^2$ bins. Typical values for the individual contributions
are given in Table~\ref{tab:sygSys}. The total uncertainty in the
signal yield is obtained by propagating the individual effects into
the $\MR$ and $\RR^2$ variables and comparing the bin-by-bin variations with respect to the central value of the prediction
based on simulation. In the particular case of the uncertainties due
to the choice of the PDF set we have followed the PDF4LHC~\cite{Bourilkov:2006cj,Alekhin:2011sk,Botje:2011sn} prescription, using the CTEQ-6.6\cite{Nadolsky:2008zw} and MRST-2006-NNLO~\cite{Martin:2007bv} PDF sets.

\section{Results and interpretation}\label{sec:interpretation}

In Figs.~\ref{fig:0muSignalBkg1GeV}~and~\ref{fig:0muttbar} the
estimated backgrounds are compared to the observed yield in each
$\MR$ region, for events without and with
b-tagged jets, respectively. The background estimates agree with the observed
yields, within the uncertainties. This result is interpreted in terms of exclusion limits
for several models of DM production.



\subsection{Limits on dark matter production from the \texorpdfstring{0$\mu$}{0 mu} sample}\label{0muResults}
\label{sec:EFT0mu}
The result is interpreted in the context of a low-energy effective
field theory, in which
the production of DM particles is mediated by six or seven dimension
operators~\cite{maverickDM,TevatronDMFrontier}. This choice allows
the results be compared with those of previous
analyses~\cite{Aad:2011xw,Chatrchyan:2012me},
and shows that a similar sensitivity is achieved.

Operators of dimension six and seven are generated assuming the
existence of a heavy particle, mediating the interaction between the
DM and SM fields. To describe DM production as a local interaction,
the propagator of the heavy mediator is expanded through an operator
product expansion. The nature of the mediator
determines the nature of the effective interaction. Two benchmark
scenarios are considered in this study, axial-vector (AV), and vector
(V) interactions~\cite{PhysRevD.85.056011}, described by the
following operators:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:OvOva}
\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{AV}}
=
\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2}}\left(\bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}\chi\right)
\left(\bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}q\right) \hspace{0.05in};\qquad
\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\mathrm{V}} =
\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2}}\left(\bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\chi\right)
\left(\bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}q\right).
\end{equation}
Here  $\gamma_{\mu}$ and $\gamma_{5}$ are the Dirac matrices, $\chi$
is the DM field, and $q$ is an SM quark field. The DM particle is assumed to be a Dirac
fermion where both operators will contribute in the low-energy theory, while in the case of a Majorana DM particle the vector coupling
$\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{V}$ will vanish in the low-energy theory.
Below the cutoff energy
scale $\Lambda$, DM production is described as a contact interaction
between two quarks and two DM particles. In the case of $s$-channel
production through a heavy mediator, the energy scale $\Lambda$ is
identified with $M/g_\text{eff}$, where $M$ is the mediator mass and
$g_\text{eff} = \sqrt{g_{q} g_{\chi}}$ is an effective
coupling, determined by the coupling of the mediator to quark and DM
fields, $g_q$ and $g_\chi$, respectively.


The results in Tables~\ref{tab:LOOKUP_VL}-\ref{tab:LOOKUP_VH} in the
Appendix are used to obtain an upper limit at 90\% confidence level
(CL) on the DM production cross section, $\sigma^{i}_{\mathrm{UL}}$ (where
the superscript denotes the coupling to an up or down quark). The
limits are obtained using the
LHC CL$_\mathrm{s}$ procedure~\cite{LHC_CLS,CMS-NOTE-2011-005} and a global likelihood determined
by combining the likelihoods of the different search categories. Each
 systematic uncertainty (see Section~\ref{sec:sys}) is incorporated in the likelihood with a dedicated nuisance parameter, whose value is not known a priori but rather must be estimated from the data.

Subsequently, the cross section ($\sigma^{i}_{\mathrm{UL}}$) limit is translated into a lower limit $\Lambda_{\mathrm{LL}}$ on
the cutoff scale, through the relation:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_\mathrm{LL} = \Lambda_\text{GEN} \left(\frac{\sigma_\text{GEN}}{\sigma_\mathrm{UL}}\right)^\frac{1}{4}.
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda_\text{GEN}$ and $\sigma_\text{GEN}$ are the cutoff
energy scale and cross section of the simulated sample, respectively.
The derived values of $\Lambda_\mathrm{LL}$ as a function of the DM mass,
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LambdaLimit}, are comparable to those derived
for the CMS monojet search~\cite{monojet8TeV}.  The analysis has been
repeated removing the events also selected by the monojet search.  The
reduction in background yields due to this additional requirement
compensates for the reduction in signal efficiency, resulting in a
negligible difference in the exclusion limit on $\Lambda$.

\caption{Lower limit at 90\% CL on the cutoff scale $\Lambda$ as a
  function of the DM mass $M_\chi$ in the case of
  axial-vector (left) and vector (right) currents. The validity of the EFT
  is quantified by $R_\Lambda = 80\%$ contours, corresponding to
  different values of the effective coupling
  $g_\text{eff}$. For completeness, regions forbidden by the
  EFT validity condition $\Lambda > 2M_\chi/g_\text{eff}$  are shown for two choices of the
effective coupling:  $g_\text{eff} = 1$ (light gray) and $g_\text{eff}= 4\pi$ (dark gray).\label{fig:LambdaLimit}}
\end{figure}

The EFT framework provides a benchmark scenario to compare
the sensitivity of this analysis with that of previous searches for
similar signatures. However, the
validity of an EFT approach is limited at the LHC because a fraction
of events under study are generated at a $\sqrt{\hat s}$ comparable to
the cutoff scale $\Lambda$~\cite{Goodman:2010ku,TevatronDMFrontier,Friedland:2011za,Buchmueller:2013dya}. For theories to be perturbative, $g_\text{eff}$ is
typically required to be smaller than $4\pi$, and this condition is
unlikely to be satisfied for the entire region of phase space probed by
the collider searches. In addition, the range
of values for the couplings being probed within the EFT may be unrealistically large. Following
the study presented in Refs.~\cite{Riotto1,Riotto2,Riotto3}, we
quantify this effect through two EFT validity measures. The first is a
minimal kinematic constraint on $\Lambda$ obtained by requiring
$Q_\text{tr} < g_\text{eff}\Lambda$ and $Q_\text{tr} >
2M_{\chi}$, where $Q_\text{tr}$ is the momentum transferred
from the mediator to the DM particle pair, which yields $\Lambda > 2M_{\chi}/g_\text{eff}$ . The second is more stringent and uses the quantity:
\begin{equation}
R_\Lambda = \frac{\int \rd\RR^2 \int \rd \MR
  \displaystyle{\left.\frac{\rd^2\sigma}{\rd\RR^2  \rd \MR}\right\vert_{Q_\text{tr}<g_\text{eff}\Lambda} }}
{\int \rd\RR^2 \int \rd \MR \displaystyle{\frac{\rd^2\sigma}{\rd\RR^2  \rd\MR}}}.
\end{equation}

Values of $R_\Lambda$ close to unity indicate a regime in which the
assumptions of the EFT approximation hold, while a deviation from unity quantifies
the fraction of events for which the EFT approximation is still valid. We
consider the case of $s$-channel production, and we compute
$R_\Lambda$ as a function of the effective coupling $g_\text{eff}$
in the range $0 < g_\text{eff} \leq 4\pi$.  The contours
corresponding to $R_\Lambda = 80\%$ for different values of
$g_\text{eff}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LambdaLimit}. For values
of $g_\text{eff} \gtrapprox 2$, the limit set by the analysis lies
above the $R_\Lambda = 80\%$ contour.

The exclusion limits on $\Lambda$ for the axial-vector and vector operators are transformed into upper limits on
the spin-dependent ($\sigma^\mathrm{SD}_{N\chi}$)~\cite{Super-Kamiokande,
  IceCube, COUPP, SIMPLE, Amole:2015lsj, Archambault:2012pm, Aprile:2013doa} and spin-independent
($\sigma^\mathrm{SI}_{N\chi}$)~\cite{SIMPLE, COUPP, CDMS-II, SuperCDMS, XENON100, LUX, Angloher:2014myn, Angloher:2015ewa}
DM-nucleon scattering cross section, respectively; using the following
expressions~\cite{PhysRevD.85.056011}:
\begin{align}
\sigma_{N\chi}^\mathrm{SD}  & =  0.33 \frac{\mu^{2}}{\pi\Lambda_\mathrm{LL}^{4}}, \\
\sigma_{N\chi}^\mathrm{SI}  & =  9 \frac{\mu^2}{\pi\Lambda_\mathrm{LL}^{4}},\\
\intertext{where}
\mu &= \frac{M_{\chi}M_{\Pp}}{M_{\chi}+M_{\Pp}},
\end{align}
with $M_{\Pp}$ and $M_\chi$ indicating the proton and
DM masses, respectively. The numerical values of the derived limits
are given in Tables~\ref{tab:AVLimit}~and~\ref{tab:VLimit}.  The
bound on $\sigma_{N\chi}$ as a function of $M_\chi$ is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:DMNxsec} for spin-dependent and spin-independent
DM-nucleon scattering. A summary of the observed limits for the axial-vector and vector operators can be found in Tables~\ref{tab:AVLimit} and~\ref{tab:VLimit} respectively

In order to compare our results with those from direct detection experiments, the experimental bounds in~\cite{SIMPLE, COUPP,CDMS-II,
  SuperCDMS, XENON100, LUX,Super-Kamiokande, IceCube, COUPP, SIMPLE}
are translated into bounds on $\Lambda$. This comparison is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:LambdaComplete}. This translation is well
defined since the momentum transfer in most direct detection
experiments is low compared to the values of $\Lambda$ being probed,
and thus the EFT approximations in question are mostly valid.

\subsection{Limits on dark matter production from the \texorpdfstring{0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb}{0 mu b and 0 mu bb} samples}

The results from the 0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb samples are interpreted in
an EFT scenario, following a methodology similar to that of
Section~\ref{sec:EFT0mu}. In this case, a heavy scalar mediator
 is considered~\cite{Lin:2013sca}, generating an operator:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Os}
\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{S} = \frac{M_{q}}{\Lambda^{3}}\bar{\chi}\chi \bar{q}q.
\end{equation}

The dependence on the mass, induced by the scalar nature of the
mediator, implies a stronger coupling to third-generation quarks,
enhancing the sensitivity of the 0$\mu$b and 0$\mu$bb samples to this
scenario. Unlike the case of V and AV operators, the production cross
section for this process is proportional to $1/\Lambda^{6}$. The
value of $\Lambda_\mathrm{LL}$ is then derived as
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_\mathrm{LL} = \Lambda_\text{GEN} \left(\frac{\sigma_\text{GEN}}{\sigma_\mathrm{UL}}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}.
\end{equation}

Given the results of Table~\ref{tab:bkg0muWITHB} we proceed to set limits at 90\%
CL on the cutoff scale (see Table~\ref{tab:MonobLimit}) using the LHC
CL$_\mathrm{s}$ procedure. To quantify the validity of the EFT we follow the
discussion in Section~\ref{sec:EFT0mu}, considering an interaction
mediated by an $s$-channel produced particle. The operator of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:Os}) is suppressed by an additional factor
$m_\PQb$/$\Lambda$ with respect to the operators in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:OvOva}). As a result, for a given value of the coupling
$g_\text{eff}$, smaller values of $\Lambda$ are probed in this
case. The observed limit stays below the contours derived for
$R_{\Lambda} = 80\%$, even when the coupling is fixed to the largest
value considered, $g_\text{eff} = 4\pi$, as shown in the left plot
of Fig.~\ref{fig:LimitLambdab}. For the same choice of coupling,
the derived limit on $\Lambda$ would correspond to $R_{\Lambda}
\approx 25\%$, as shown in the right plot of
Fig.~\ref{fig:LimitLambdab}. Only for $g_\text{eff} > 4\pi$ does the
observed limit correspond to values of $R_{\Lambda}>80\%$. This
requirement implies a UV completion of the EFT beyond
the perturbative regime. For this reason, this result is not
interpreted in terms of an exclusion limit on $\sigma_{N\chi}$.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:conclusions}

A search for dark matter has been performed studying proton-proton collisions collected
with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of
8\TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of
18.8\fbinv, collected with a dedicated high-rate trigger in 2012,
made possible by the creation of parked data, and processed during the LHC shutdown
in 2013.

Events with at least two jets are analyzed by studying the
distribution in the ($\MR$, $\RR^2$) plane, in an
event topology complementary to that of monojet searches. Events with one or
two muons are used in conjunction with simulated samples, to predict
the expected background from standard model processes, mainly
$\cPZ$+jets and $\PW$+jets. The analysis is performed on events both
with and without b-tagged jets, originating from the hadronization of
a bottom quark, where in the latter case the dominant background comes from
$\ttbar$.

No significant excess is observed. The results are presented as
exclusion limits on dark matter production at 90\% confidence level
for models based on effective operators and for different assumptions
on the interaction between the dark matter particles and the colliding
partons. Dark matter production at the LHC is excluded for a mediator
mass scale $\Lambda$ below 1\TeV in the case of a vector or axial
vector operator. While the sensitivity achieved is similar to those of previously
published searches, this analysis complements those results since the
use of razor variables provides more inclusive selection criteria and
since the exploitation of parked data allows events with small values of $\MR$ to be included.
